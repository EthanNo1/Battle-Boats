You and a computer are given five boats of varying sizes, which you must place:
  - 2x Destroyers B
  - 2x Submarines BB
  - 1x Carrier BBB

You play "Rock, Paper, Scissors" against the computer, with the winner going first.
You must then try and guess the coordinates of the computer's ships, before they guess the coordinates of yours.
If you hit all of the parts of a ship, that ship "sinks". This information can tell you when to try adjacent tiles and when to try elsewhere.
A "hit" is shown by a 'H' on the grid, a miss with 'M', and a sink with 'S'.
